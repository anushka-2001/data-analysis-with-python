# *Introduction*

- This is a **Data Analysis With Python** practical, beginner-friendly and coding-focused introduction to data analysis covering the basics of Python, Numpy, Pandas, data visualization and exploratory data analysis.

- This is a part of **[Jovian.ml](https://jovian.ml/learn)** course, in association with **[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)**.

- Here is the complete ***Youtube Playlist*** for **[Data Analysis With Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAblvI1i46ScbKV2jH1gdL7VQ)**.

- All my learnings and notebooks can be viewed on **[My Jovian.ml Profile](https://jovian.ml/tusharnankani3)**

    - *Jovian.ml is like Github for Jupyter Notebooks*. It is very helpful.

    - Running using free online resources. The easiest way to start executing this notebook is to click the "Run" button at the top of this page, and select *"Run on Binder"*. This will run the notebook on mybinder.org, a *free online service for running Jupyter notebooks*. You can also select *"Run on Colab"* or *"Run on Kaggle"*, but you'll need to create an account on Google Colab or Kaggle to use these platforms.

    - Whether you're running this Jupyter notebook on an online service like Binder or on your local machine, it's important to save your work from time, so that you can access it later, or share it online. You can upload this notebook to your Jovian.ml account using the **`jovian` Python library**.

First, you need to install the Jovian python library, if it isn't already installed, and then import it.

```python
!pip install jovian --upgrade --quiet
import jovian
```

# *Numerical Computations with NumPy*

Going through the basics of NumPy.

- [Numerical Computing with Numpy - Notebook on GitHub](https://github.com/tusharnankani/data-analysis-with-python/tree/main/1-numerical-computations-with-numpy)

If the notebook doesn't load, on Github, view it on Jovian.

- [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlZXAytUeeE&list=PLWKjhJtqVAblvI1i46ScbKV2jH1gdL7VQ&index=3)

## *Five NumPy operation, I bet you don't know!*

This was a part of the assignment for NumPy Operations.

- [Numpy Operations - Notebook on GitHub](https://github.com/tusharnankani/data-analysis-with-python/tree/main/2-numpy-array-operations)

### **100 NumPy Exercises**

It is not possible to know all functions of this huge library, the best way is to get an idea, is to look at the problem and solve it.

# *Analyzing Tabular Data with Pandas*

Going through the basics of Pandas, via a *Case Study* - **Italy Covid Data Analysis**.

- [Data Analysis with Pandas - Notebook on GitHub](https://github.com/tusharnankani/data-analysis-with-python/tree/main/3-data-analysis-with-pandas)

If the notebook doesn't load, on Github, view it on Jovian.

## *Covid-19 World-wide Analysis*

This was a part of the assignment for Pandas Analysis - Pre-processing, **asking questions** and *answering them after analysing* the Datasets.

- [Covid 19 Data Analysis - Notebook on GitHub](https://github.com/tusharnankani/data-analysis-with-python/tree/main/4-covid19-data-analysis)

- [Covid 19 Data Analysis - Notebook on Jovian](https://jovian.ml/tusharnankani3/pandas-practice-assignment)

# *Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn*

Once done with pre-processing and analysing Datasets, it's time to visualize them! Visualizing data is an essential part of data analysis and machine learning.

- [Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn - GitHub](https://github.com/tusharnankani/data-analysis-with-python/tree/main/5-python-matplotlib-seaborn-data-visualization)

If the notebook doesn't load, on Github, view it on Jovian.

- [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bybjFBOBJlg&list=PLWKjhJtqVAblvI1i46ScbKV2jH1gdL7VQ&index=5)

# *Real-time project - An exhaustive Whatsapp Chat Data Analysis*

- The complete project can be viewed on the repository - [whatsapp-chat-analysis](https://github.com/topics/whatsapp-analysis).

- If the notebook doesn't load, the complete notebook can be viewed on [Whatsapp Chat Analysis](https://github.com/topics/whatsapp-analysis) website, the notebook as been embedded in a `index.html` file, so that the complete analysis could be viewed easily.

#### *Where to go from here?*

- Exploring more datasets! It is *never-ending*, there can be ***Infinite Stories with Data***!
    - [awesome-public-datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
    - [Thread of Intreseting Datasets](https://jovian.ml/forum/t/recommended-datasets-for-course-project/11711)
- Once, done with enough Data Analysis, try making Datasets, scraping Data from websites and creating Interesting Datasets! 
- Trying hands on Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
